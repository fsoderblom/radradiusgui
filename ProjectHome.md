Rad Radius GUI (RRG) was developed on assignment from Skatteverket (the Swedish National Taxboard) to manage MAC based authentication in a 802.1X environment using the FreeRADIUS server. It gives support for maintaining VLAN assignments, administer and importing MAC addresses from virtually any ASCII based format (CSV, Cut-and-paste etc), health checks on the FreeRADIUS server in use and extensive logging with a flexible search interface, also it utilizes an internal user database with simple roles on who can change or add objects (VLAN, MAC addresses etc) to the FreeRADIUS server.

The code has been developed and released as GPLv3 on specific request from Skatteverket (the Swedish National Taxboard), to ensure that other agencies or the public could possibly benefit from it.

The project is fully coded in PHP and utilizes MySQL internally and for relevant FreeRADIUS tables.

**NOTE:** Project is currently only in Swedish.
